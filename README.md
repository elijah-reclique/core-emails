# core-emails
These files contain HTML for transactional emails inside of ReClique CORE, a MMS for YMCAs. Ys are free to copy these email templates/parts for their own email marketing purposes.

## How It Works
Each file in this repo corresponds to a tag CORE uses in its emails system. Tags are marked with **%tagname%**, with the *%* character opening and closing the tag.

HTML comments in each file denote where in the email the HTML should be placed.
